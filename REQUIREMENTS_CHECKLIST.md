## 1.1 MONTHLY RETAINER SYSTEM (Key Feature)

**Overview:** The platform supports both one-time affiliate offers AND ongoing monthly retainer contracts where companies hire creators for regular video production.

### How It Works:

**For Companies:**
1. Create retainer contract specifying:
   - Monthly payment amount
   - Number of videos required per month
   - Contract duration (in months)
   - Requirements and description
2. Post contract for creators to discover
3. Review creator applications (portfolio, message, stats)
4. Approve selected creators (multiple creators can be assigned)
5. Review monthly deliverables as they're submitted
6. Approve/reject/request revisions on deliverables
7. Automated payment triggers on deliverable approval

**For Creators:**
1. Browse available retainer contracts at `/creator-retainers`
2. Apply with portfolio links and introduction message
3. If approved, submit monthly deliverables (video URLs + descriptions)
4. Track deliverable status (pending, approved, rejected, revision_requested)
5. Receive automated payment when deliverable is approved
6. View all active retainer contracts and earnings

### Implementation Details:

| Component | Status | Details | Improvements Needed |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------------------|
| Database Tables | ✅ | `retainerContracts`, `retainerApplications`, `retainerDeliverables`, `retainerPayments` | None |
| Company Pages | ✅ | `/company-retainers` - Create and manage contracts | None |
| Creator Pages | ✅ | `/creator-retainers` - Browse, apply, submit deliverables | None |
| Application System | ✅ | Portfolio links, message, approval workflow | None |
| Deliverable Workflow | ✅ | 4 states: pending → approved/rejected/revision_requested | None |
| Payment Automation | ✅ | Auto-created on deliverable approval with fee calculation | None |
| Multi-Creator Support | ✅ | Companies can hire multiple creators per contract | None |
| Status Tracking | ✅ | Real-time tracking of contract and deliverable status | None |
| Video Upload System | ✅ | Cloudinary integration with folder organization | ✅ **FIXED (2025-11-04):** Retainer upload uses signed uploads to bypass preset folder override. Offer videos → `videos/` (preset), Retainer videos → `retainer/` (signed) |

### API Endpoints (11 total):

**Company Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/company/retainer-contracts` - Create contract
- `GET /api/company/retainer-contracts` - List company's contracts

- `PATCH /api/company/retainer-applications/:id/reject` - Reject creator
- `PATCH /api/company/retainer-deliverables/:id/approve` - Approve deliverable (triggers payment)
- `PATCH /api/company/retainer-deliverables/:id/reject` - Reject deliverable
- `PATCH /api/company/retainer-deliverables/:id/revision` - Request revision

### Payment Calculation:
```
Per-Video Amount = Monthly Amount ÷ Videos Per Month
Platform Fee (4%) = Per-Video Amount × 0.04
Stripe Fee (3%) = Per-Video Amount × 0.03
Creator Net Amount = Per-Video Amount - Platform Fee - Stripe Fee
```

**Retainer System Status:** ✅ **100% Complete** (12/12 features implemented)

### Recent Updates (2025-11-04)

**Latest Session Achievements (Session 4 - Continued):**
- ✅ **Fixed retainer video upload folder issue** - Upload preset was overriding folder parameter
  - **Issue:** Upload preset `creatorlink-videos` has pre-configured folder in Cloudinary that overrides runtime folder parameter
  - **Root Cause:** When using upload presets, Cloudinary preset configuration takes precedence over FormData folder parameter
  - **Fix:** Modified upload logic to use signed uploads (not presets) when custom folder is specified
  - **Changes:**
    - `server/objectStorage.ts:38-102` - Added conditional logic to choose upload method
    - When `customFolder` is provided → Use SIGNED upload (signature + timestamp + api_key)
    - When default folder → Use PRESET upload (upload_preset)
    - Added debug logging to track upload method selection
  - **Result:**
    - Retainer uploads now use signed uploads → Videos save to `retainer/` folder
    - Offer uploads continue using preset → Videos save to `videos/` folder
    - Folder parameters are now properly respected
- ✅ **Fixed retainer video upload process** - Replaced CloudinaryUploader with direct upload matching offer upload flow
  - **Issue:** Retainer video upload was not working - used complex CloudinaryUploader component with Uppy library
  - **Fix:** Replaced with simple, direct FormData upload identical to offer video upload process
  - **Changes:**
    - Removed CloudinaryUploader component dependency from retainer upload
    - Added direct file input with ref and FormData upload
    - Simplified upload to use same flow as offers (fetch → FormData → Cloudinary)
    - Added upload progress state with visual feedback
    - File validation (max 500MB)
  - **Result:**
    - Retainer video upload now works reliably
    - Simplified upload UX with clear progress indicators
    - Bundle size reduced: 1,420 kB → 1,226 kB (-194 kB)
- ✅ **Implemented complete video folder organization** - All videos now properly organized in Cloudinary by type
  - **Issue:** All videos (offers + retainers) were saving to the same default folder, making organization and management difficult
  - **Fix:** Added dynamic folder parameter support to upload endpoint and updated all video upload locations
  - **Backend Changes:**
    - `server/routes.ts:1619-1624` - Updated `/api/objects/upload` to accept optional `folder` parameter in request body
    - `server/objectStorage.ts:38-75` - Added `customFolder` parameter to `getObjectEntityUploadURL()` method
  - **Frontend Changes:**
    - `client/src/pages/company-offer-create.tsx` - Updated 3 upload calls (video + thumbnails) to use `{ folder: "videos" }`
    - `client/src/pages/company-offer-detail.tsx` - Updated 2 upload calls (video + thumbnail) to use `{ folder: "videos" }`
    - `client/src/pages/creator-retainer-detail.tsx` - Completely rewrote upload to use direct FormData with `{ folder: "retainer" }`
  - **Result:**
    - **Offer videos & thumbnails** → `videos/` folder
    - **Retainer videos** → `retainer/` folder
    - Clean separation for better file management and organization
- ✅ **Added Improvements column to requirements checklist** - New column tracks what needs to be changed or improved
  - **Location:** Monthly Retainer System section (1.1) Implementation Details table
  - **Purpose:** Track ongoing improvements and recent fixes for better project visibility
- ✅ **Fixed SelectItem empty value error** - Resolved Radix UI validation error in admin audit logs page
  - **Issue:** SelectItem components don't allow empty string values (`value=""`)
  - **Fix:** Changed filter selects to use `undefined` for placeholder state instead of empty strings
  - **Files:** client/src/pages/admin-audit-logs.tsx (lines 94-124)
  - **Result:** Audit logs page now loads without errors, filters work correctly

**Session 4 Initial Achievements:**
- ✅ **Implemented admin audit trail** - Complete audit logging system with comprehensive tracking of all admin actions (approve company, reject offer, suspend user, update settings, etc.)
  - **Backend:** auditLogs table with userId, action, entityType, entityId, changes (JSONB), reason, ipAddress, userAgent, timestamp
  - **Backend:** Audit service (auditLog.ts) with logAuditAction() function and predefined action/entity constants
  - **Backend:** Storage layer methods for retrieving and filtering audit logs
  - **Backend:** API endpoints: GET /api/admin/audit-logs with query filters
  - **Frontend:** Admin UI at /admin/audit-logs with filters for action, entity type, user ID, limit
