# Cloudinary Setup Guide

Your video upload feature uses Cloudinary to store and serve video files. Follow these steps to set it up:

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Create Cloudinary Account

1. Go to [Cloudinary Signup](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free)
2. Sign up with your email or GitHub account
3. Choose the **Free Plan** (includes 25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth/month)
4. Verify your email address
5. Complete the onboarding

### 2. Get Your Credentials

After signing in, you'll see your dashboard with your credentials:

1. Go to [Cloudinary Console Dashboard](https://console.cloudinary.com/console)
2. Find your **Account Details** section (top of the dashboard)
3. You'll see three important values:
   - **Cloud Name**: Your unique cloud identifier (e.g., `dxyz123abc`)
   - **API Key**: Your public API key (e.g., `123456789012345`)
   - **API Secret**: Your private API secret (e.g., `AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz`)

### 3. Add Credentials to .env

Open your `.env` file and update the Cloudinary configuration:

```env
# Cloudinary Configuration (REQUIRED for video uploads)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name-here
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret-here
```

**Example:**
```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dxyz123abc
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=123456789012345
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz
```

### 4. (Optional) Create Upload Preset for Unsigned Uploads

For simpler uploads, you can create an upload preset:

1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Upload** in your Cloudinary dashboard
2. Scroll down to **Upload presets**
3. Click **Add upload preset**
4. Configure:
   - **Name**: `creatorlink-videos`
   - **Signing Mode**: Unsigned
   - **Folder**: `creatorlink/videos` (optional)
   - **Resource type**: Auto
5. Click **Save**

Then add to your `.env`:
```env
CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=creatorlink-videos
```

**Note:** If you don't set an upload preset, the system will use signed uploads (more secure).

### 5. Restart Server

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### 6. Test Video Upload

1. Go to an approved retainer contract or offer
2. Click "Submit Video" or "Upload Video"
3. Upload a video file
4. Should upload successfully to Cloudinary! âœ…

## How It Works

### Video Upload Flow

1. **Frontend** requests upload parameters from backend (`/api/objects/upload`)
2. **Backend** generates Cloudinary signature or returns upload preset
3. **Frontend** uploads video directly to Cloudinary (not through your server)
4. **Cloudinary** processes and stores the video
5. **Frontend** receives the video URL and saves it to database

### Video Serving

Videos are served directly from Cloudinary's CDN:
- URL format: `https://res.cloudinary.com/your-cloud/video/upload/v123456/folder/filename.mp4`
- Automatic optimization and adaptive streaming
- Fast global delivery via CDN

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Upload failed"

**Check your credentials:**
```bash
# In your .env file:
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=... # Must match your dashboard
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=...    # Must match your dashboard
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=... # Must match your dashboard (keep secret!)
```

**Restart your server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Error: "Invalid signature"

- âœ… Make sure `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` is correct
- âœ… Check that there are no extra spaces in `.env` values
- âœ… Restart server after updating `.env`

### Error: "Upload preset not found"

If using unsigned upload preset:
- âœ… Create the preset in Cloudinary dashboard (Settings â†’ Upload â†’ Upload presets)
- âœ… Set signing mode to **Unsigned**
- âœ… Update `CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET` in `.env`
- âœ… Restart server

Or remove `CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET` to use signed uploads instead.

### Videos upload but show as broken

- âœ… Check that the `secure_url` is being saved to database (not `url`)
- âœ… Use HTTPS URLs (`https://res.cloudinary.com/...`)
- âœ… Verify video format is supported (MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM, etc.)

### File size too large

Free plan limits:
- âœ… Max file size: 100MB per upload
- âœ… For larger files, upgrade to a paid plan or compress videos before upload

## Security Best Practices

1. âœ… **Never commit** `.env` file to git
2. âœ… **Add to .gitignore:**
   ```
   .env
   .env.local
   .env.production
   ```
3. âœ… **Rotate API secrets** regularly (every 90 days)
4. âœ… **Use signed uploads** for production (more secure than unsigned)
5. âœ… **Set upload restrictions** in Cloudinary dashboard:
   - Maximum file size
   - Allowed formats (video only)
   - Resource types

## Advanced Features

### Video Transformations

Cloudinary can automatically:
- **Optimize quality** for faster loading
- **Generate thumbnails** from video frames
- **Convert formats** (MP4, WebM, etc.)
- **Add watermarks** to protect content
- **Adaptive bitrate streaming** for smooth playback

Example URL with transformation:
```
https://res.cloudinary.com/your-cloud/video/upload/
  q_auto,        # Auto quality
  f_auto,        # Auto format
  w_800          # Max width 800px
/creatorlink/videos/video-id.mp4
```

### Access Control

For private videos:
1. Enable **Strict transformations** in dashboard
2. Use **signed URLs** with expiration
3. Configure **allowed domains** for video embedding

### Analytics

Track video performance:
1. Go to **Reports** â†’ **Usage** in dashboard
2. View:
   - Storage usage
   - Bandwidth consumption
   - Transformation requests
   - Popular videos
